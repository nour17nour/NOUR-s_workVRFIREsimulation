# NOUR-s_workVRFIREsimulation
This is Nour's work for VR simulation CPE final project. This VR simulation is a fire simulation that teaches users what to do incase of a fire emergency. 

My option is the VR Fire simulation is option 3 titled: Home Fire Hazard potential common dangers. The user when choosing this option, will enter a living room scene. There will be a welcoming message "Hello! Welcome to "Home Fire Hazard potentail common dangers"! There are three potentail safety hazards in this room that you should guess. Point towards the three objects that are misplaced and that can cause a fire! Hints: something illuminating, something that cause warmth, and something that ensure connectivity!! Good luck!! 

User manual:
The user will wear the VR Oculus headset and will hold the Oculus controllers and move using the controllers around the room. This allows the user to reach the 3 objects closer and point/ touch the objects needed. When the user wears the headset, they will able to see the scene. For the ledt and right handside controllers, there are the thumbsticks to move around, and the grip buttons to touch the objects.


This VR prject was a new expereince I am glad I undertook and proud of my outcome. However, some potential challenges I faced and how would I have done things differently if I do it again.: 

1. the downloading and large space probelm of the project. Each time i needed to work, the downloading of the files would take time and transferring it from perhaps the desktop on the lab's computer to an external hard disk or to my own googledrive would take so much time. Even when using a zipFile, it woukd still sometimes take so much. 

2. finding suitable, free sources to use as VR assets to build the scene. I needed the VR scene to be as realistic as possible as it is about home safety fire hazards. I might needed more research about other sources that provide and support free unity assests (not just the unity asset store and Sketchfab). 

3. Some user might expereince motion sickness when moving around even though I tried as much as possible to reduce motion sickness and create a comfortable expereince for users. At the end of the day, it depends on each user separately. I can experiment with different interaction models and maybe let different users from differen age groups try the VR simulation.

4. This VR simulation is a single player and not a multiplayer one. What can I do is making it a multiplayer simulation to encourage teamwork and allow for collaboration.
